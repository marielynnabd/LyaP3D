# LyaP3D

LyaP3D is a Python pipeline for measuring the cross-power spectrum (Px) and 3D power spectrum (P3D) of the Lyman-alpha forest in quasar spectra at small scales. 
It supports analysis on both **simulated datasets** and **real observational data** from surveys 
such as the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)

## Features

- Compute **Px** and **P3D** from Lyman-alpha forests
- Generate synthetic quasar and Lyman-alpha forest datasets based on Nyx simulations and Quick Quasars
- Preprocess observational DESI or eBOSS data in preparation to running the **Px** and **P3D** computation
- Deployed on high-performance computing systems such as  
  **NERSC** (US Department of Energy) and **Feynman** (CEA, France)
- Example Bash and Python execution scripts available upon request
